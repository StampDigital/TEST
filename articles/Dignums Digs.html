	  <h1>Dignum's Digs: On Fashion</h1>
      <h2>Izzy Dignum </h2>
      <div class="article_text"><br>
      <p>
       Fashion plays an integral part in defining &dash; and expressing &dash; who we are. For example, I liked Gucci&#39s embroidered bumblebees on their menswear, and Dolce and Gabbana&#39s rose motif, and the Viktor and Rolf wearable art haute couture collection. This shows that I have expensive taste, and that by the time I move out and have a full-time job, I will look killer, yet will probably only be surviving on own-brand supermarket soup.
	   Even though sometimes I look like a transvestite with a penchant for novelty footwear &dash; who doesn&#39t love a bit of glitter? &dash; I am usually safe in the knowledge that no-one will turn up anywhere looking remotely similar to me. Not that they&#39d want to. I take pride in the fact that I thrift, and search up and down cities for vintage stores; sacrificing the wellbeing of my feet and the coating on my silver loafers in the process. There are many things that I&#39m prepared to do in the name of fashion. But shopping at Urban Outfitters is not one of them.

        <p/><br>
        <p>
         A couple of years ago, it was my favourite store. I swooned over their breezily minimalistic sweatshirts, artfully ripped jeans and infamous Kanken backpacks. The entire UO vibe epitomised who I wanted to be; an artistic, alternative soul with beautiful taste, beautiful hair, and a beautiful face. The models &dash; and the mannequins &dash; seemed able to pull anything off, from wide-leg, boot cut jeans to &pound;235 flannel joggers that look extraordinarily similar to the pyjamas that I am wearing right now. If they could do it, so could I.
		Alas, those days of naivety have long passed, and my purse-strings have tightened. The grown-up inside me eventually woke up and asked (as it still does now) &#39You have one choice. You can spend &pound;80 on a pair of dungarees with holes in, which, quite frankly, you could have created yourself. Or, you can *insert more rewarding purchase/pastime here&#39. I have realised that I don&#39t want to shop somewhere that masquerades new items as &#39upcycled&#39, or charges ridiculous amounts of money for a sheer slip that can supposedly be worn as daywear.
		There is a difference between style and fashion. Style is effortless and timeless; it is the ability to throw on random articles of clothing, and still manage to carry it with an air of sophistication and glamour. Fashion, on the other hand, is having enough money to buy this season&#39s &#39must&dash;haves&#39, and thus look like everyone else. Urban Outfitters is the epitome of the latter; it stocks whatever will make enough profit, and what will be deemed &#39indie&#39, and will therefore have flocks of people running towards them, tossing their wallets as they fall.
		I&#39ve had enough of normcore. Bring on the sparkly brogues.
