      <p>
        Over the past week (Monday 18th April &dash; Friday 22nd April) there have been a number of events to raise money for the Children Of Choba Kitchen Campaign, on 21st there was a University Challenge for teachers and although time ran out and they were unable to finish all the rounds it was a success with a large turn out from the majority of years. It was run by 11M with two teams competing, team history and team theology. Team history were Mr Sturdee, Miss Delport, Mr Barker and Mr Spicer on team theology were Mrs Parsons, Mr Taylor, Mrs Hicks and Miss Natrass, team theology managed to win the challenge. In an unexpected twist the crowd managed to win 10 points for answering questions neither team could answer and came in third place. The challenge was being hosted by Niamh Garvey and Oliver Heaven, with Allana Stanley keeping score for both teams. They managed to raise over &pound;60 with this challenge that was also enjoyed by many.

       Another event that happened on Friday was a dodge ball match between teachers and students with a number of teachers participating including Mr Taylor, Mrs Alsop, Miss Portingale and many more teachers. It was thoroughly enjoyed by all with a huge turnout of students and teachers a like to watch and enjoy the matches, they seemed to have raised a lot of money however we do not know the figure right now. At the same time there was an event taking place behind the gallery building run by year 8 students called &lsquo;The Wellie Wang&rsquo; where they threw wellies and measured how far they went, in order to raise money for the kitchen campaign. There are more events being run to support this project, which hope to raise even more money.
