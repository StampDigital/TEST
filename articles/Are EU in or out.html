        Even though most people who will be reading this are unable to vote, I think it is a good idea to have knowledge, even a basic knowledge, of the &#39ins and outs&#39 of  our country, especially when it will effect all of us so greatly.
		First things first, what is a referendum and what is the EU?
		A referendum is a vote that people over 18 can take part in to usually answer a yes or no question. In this circumstance the question being answered is &#39Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the EU or leave the EU?&#39 to which people can either vote &#39Remain a member of the EU&#39 or &#39Leave the EU&#39.
		The European Union grew out of the desire for peace in a continent which had been devastated and torn apart by war. To begin with, six countries signed a treaty to pool their coal and steal resources and it has expanded from there to have 28 member states and a total population of 500 million. The four institutions working together to make the EU run smoothly are the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of EU and the European Commission.  According to treasury figures, the net contribution of the UK to the EU in 2015 was &pound8.5 billion, but all countries receive money back as a contribution to support development.

        <p/><br>
        <p>
        The referendum is taking place on Thursday 23rd June as the British government promised to hold a referendum before 2017. As the EU has grown increasingly more powerful, the calls for a vote on whether to stay or leave have become popular. Prime minister David Cameron thinks that it is vital for Britain to stay in the EU, and those who are campaigning for the Britain to stay in the EU agree with him.
		The campaign launched to campaign for Britain to stay in the EU is called &#39Britain Stronger in EU&#39 which Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of Marks and Spencers, is heading.  Another face that is joining him is Karen Brady who you might recognise from The Apprentice.
		Boris Johnson has suggested that he will vote no, as he wants to force Brussels to make the deal better for the UK. There are three &#39out&#39 campaigns; &#39Vote Leave&#39, &#39Leave EU&#39 and &#39Grassroots Out&#39. Some of the figure heads of these campaigns are Michael Gove, the former education secretary, who is part of the &#39Vote Leave&#39. The founders of &#39Grassroots out&#39 are Conservative MP Peter Bone and labour MP Kate Hoey.

        </p><br>
       <h2>What does it mean for the UK if we leave the EU?</h2>
	   <p>
		 If we leave the EU we would have to negotiate new trading relationships with the what would be the remaining 27 members, without excessive tariffs and other limitations. In regards to jobs leave campaigners say that jobs available would boom as there would be no relegations from the EU. The remain campaigners say that millions of jobs would be lost as global manufactures move to lower cost EU-countries.
