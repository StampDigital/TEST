	  <h1>The STAB In The Back</h1>
      <h2>The Process of creating STAMP</h2>
	  <h2>By Nicole Micheli</h2>
      <div class="article_text"><br>
      <h3>Why STAB in the back?</h3>
	  <p>
        Originally, STAMP (St Augustine&#39;s Magazine for the Pupils) would have been STAB (St Augustine&#39;s Bulletin). However, after consideration of how the word &lsquo;STAB&rsquo; written all over our school magazine would look to outsiders, we thought; maybe not. To compensate, Mr Kenrick let us feature &lsquo;STAB in the back&rsquo; in the back of STAMP. So now, after completing reading our triumphant 1st issue of STAMP, you can read all about the triumphs and the difficulties of actually creating a different, &lsquo;not your typical school&rsquo; magazine.

        <p/><br>
        <h3>The meetings</h3>
		<p>
          We met every Tuesday and Friday to try and overcome the various obstacles which presented themselves when creating a magazine from scratch, everything from the articles we needed and the photos to the exact font size (not to forget heading font and size, sub-heading font size, pull quote font and pull quote style... the list became endless) and the positioning of the logo. People from all over the school were involved, from enthusiastic (albeit sometimes chaotic) photographers in Year 7 to Year 13s willing attempt to answer deep philosophical questions, all in th ename of STAMP.

		</p><br>
        <h3>Initials inspiration</h3>
		<p>
		Pinterest played a massive role in the inspiration for STAMP. All the editors gloated over their brilliant Pinterest boards which consisted mostly of minimalist magazine designs and photos which dominate pages, hence our front page (we told the photographers to find photo associated with spring). We sifted through loads of half-formed ideas and settled on the best ones- we wanted a magazine which is modern, edgy (not your typical school mag), minimalist and interesting, using a spring colour scheme and the most classy looking fonts we could find on Microsoft Word.



         </p><br>
		 <h3>The layout</h3>
		 <p>
			I think everyone involved in STAMP owes a massive thank you to Izzy Dignum, who stayed up most of one night to come up with the layout of our magazine. Due to the fact that Izzy was probably overly exhausted and was already having a bad day, the original layout template is packed full of pictures of cute cats. Yes, cats. Those pictures have now, regrettably, ben deleted and replaced for photos that are more suitable, but for your benefit we have left 1 rather adorable picture on this page. Enjoy.
