	  <h1>The Lady in the Mountain </h1>
      <h2>Tom Milnes </h2>
      <div class="article_text"><br>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a young princess whose fame spread far and wide for being the most beautiful maiden in all the land. Every man in the kingdom 		went to see her, but alas they could not have her. In Lower Pomerania there&#39s this mountain of pure diamond. It takes a year to find it, and only a 				        second to mar it. A young prince, destined for her love and familiar with such fraternity,
		made his way to the Diamond Mountain inside which she lay for all eternity. Like all others before him, he thought himself worthy of her hand. 	Not        knowing the path, he rested to pick her flowers in the marshland. Sunken in the marsh, there were many skulls and the soil itself ran red; and budding        white lilies lay still like salt sprinkled on a wound&#58 some splashed with blood, others not.
		The land was scarred as he travelled further into the wilderness, resting again. He pondered her lips and went on his way. Voyaging an ocean of skulls, he became lost in the dead&#59 and then Death, crooked and cloaked in burnt and tyrant linen, came lurching toward him, and        huffed, &#147Do you look for the lady in the mountain?&#148 The prince asked, &#147Who are you?&#148 &#147I am Death, who wishes no more than for you to find her.&#148
 		The prince said, &#148I have travelled 364 days to get here. I do indeed look for the lady in the mountain, the most beautiful maiden in all the land.        Will you guide me to the foot of the mountain?&#148
 		Death said, &#147I will be but one step-behind. Wherever you go; you will feel my breath on your neck and hear my voice in your ear, saying, &#39This is        the way&#59 walk in it.&#39 &#148
 		Then the prince was led by Death further into the wilderness. After abstaining for another
		day, he was truly burdened with affection. She grew strong and fierce in his mind, with cancerous thoughts ravaging his capacity for sadness&#59 entirely        adjourned for theories of face and its natural adornment, he wept silent. Determined upon the ideal, he broke forth of his hunger and pained steps of        skin that led to the gates of what he deemed foolishly his.

         He slept for his final night, ready for the spliced dawn, but awoke smiling.  Staring at the stag that wondered these hills, he found it tame and solemn. Clambering to his feet, he pondered its speed, its fury, its power -  its majesty. It was a mighty beast, much like himself he thought. He then returned to the ground, thinking her a dream and restless for the new day; she shone in his heart, most fiercely.
		As morning broke steadily, he arose. Soon after he arrived at the foot of the Diamond Mountain; peering beneath the rock to catch her gaze. It was stark, with tainted snow immersing the isle. His hands were soft but his lips more so; with the white lilies long withered, he blew her a kiss. The prize for bearing the road to the mountain. At his feet was flesh; mutton floorboards, some recent and others ancient.
		There were footprints scattered from times before, and a single gun held by a buried hand, to which her delicate, positioned finger pointed.
		And the young prince said, &#148You are mine. I have ventured through mounds of mud and men, hills of soil and skulls &#151 to find you.  But I am here now. I am here to look upon the beauty and to think it... to know it... mine.&#148 But then, finally drawn from her face&#59 he noticed something on her finger. To his dismay, it was a ring&#58 she was taken.
		It was a lure and a trap... with beauty as bait.

		One must be weary of the voice that shrouds reason for desire, for such a thing is Death.  He will breathe upon your neck, lusting for your end &#151 because he must. He must eat, like any other thing. Fed with blood drawn and roused by screams, he is the End incarnate. Sorry for his right, but indulgent for his prey, he is no monster but mercy. Death is merciful! Death is rife!
		The prince stood there, cold and wronged. Brute fact proved too hard. With such, he saw the stains that bathed the mountain, the skulls in which he walked upon and the flesh in which he sat. What shame, blood has to bear; it is faraday to the soul, a liquid guardian that spreads with the beating of the heart. Blind but eyes open, he read engraved upon the face of the Diamond Mountain:
		When the maiden rests and the wind stands fair, he  shall rise from your despair. And when all is done and you are dead, you shall know that she was wed.
		With that he fell, broken from the desire that plagues all his kind. On his knees, the lilies now soaked in the blood of his predecessors, he cried, &#147That&#39s the thing about life&#59 it&#39s only a short&#151term problem!&#148
		Taking the gun from the hand of the last...
		He fired&#58 to fall only into Death&#39s arms&#59 who stands a breath behind. And Death said, &#147I am here to catch you when you fall&#59 in my arms I catch you all.&#148
		And once more, the purity of the diamond is marred.
		Wedded and hidden away beyond any man&#39s reach, she was discovered. Since then, every day, a man arrives. He blasts his life onto the Diamond Mountain. And when the entire mountain has been rendered in shame, the first second of eternity will have passed.
