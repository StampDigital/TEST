      <p>
	  To raise money for Children of Choba, 9F organised a talent show on the 25th of April. A good audience turned out as the 4 acts showed off their talents.
		First up was Jack Laffey, 9C, who stepped up to perform as there were only 3 other acts, and played the guitar to the song Imagine by John Lennon, unfortunately the guitar wasn&#39t tuned so it did sound a bit off but all credit to him for stepping up to do it and help out.
		<p/><br>
        <p>
         Next was Jack Salty, 7F, who sang &#39See You Again&#39 by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, the crowd really got involved with his act and thoroughly enjoyed it and at the end he received a very loud applause.
		Act number three was also in year 7, who sung 7 years by Lucas Graham which everyone enjoyed.
		The final act of the day sung &#39Lush Life&#39 by Zara Larsson which also received a good applause.
		Well done to 9F for organising a fun and entertaining which raised lots of money for the Children of Choba campaign.
