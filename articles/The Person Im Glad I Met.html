	  <h1>An Interview with Clover Kayne</h1>
      <h2>Interviewed by Matt Wykes</h2>
	  <h2>In Shalott House </h2>
      <div class="article_text"><br>
      <p>
	     The St. Augustine&#39s own &#39Poetry by Heart&#39 tournament dropped anchor recently in a striking attempt to establish which bright young poetry star would advance forward to the regional competition for a chance of winning the ultimate supreme title. Clover Kayne (Year 12) sits opposite me now as the newly&mdash;crowned St. Augustine&#39s Champion, and, with a talented background like hers, the news of her evident success doesn&#39t surprise me in the least.
		&ldquo;I originally started loving the arts  when, I was 12, as I had recently started at St. Augustine&#39s&rdquo; You may recognise Clover as not only a young actress, appearing in shows such as &#39Under Milk Wood&#39 at the Rondo Theatre in Bath, and of course  staring in St. Augustine&#39s very own Musical extravaganza of Oliver!, but she has also won second place at Young Musician a legion of times.

        <p/><br>

		&ldquo;It became a marriage of singing and acting and I was intrigued by the idea of inviting people into your world as a character or a persona and letting them experience, first hand, how that character or persona is feeling&rdquo; This is clearly someone who is besotted with delving into a text  and being able to share it with an audience  who might not clearly understand, but she is able to express this piece of text in a way that they will understand.
		When asked how Clover came to choose the poems recited at &#39Poetry by Heart&#39, she simply replied &ldquo;I sort of just narrowed them down by which ones felt easiest to say, which ones I could relate to most and which ones I thought would enhance my performance by being most enjoyable for myself&rdquo; There must have been at least 400 poems on the   Poetry by Heart shortlist dating from the early 1200s to about two years ago. A clear sign of hard work, determination and perseverance.
		As Clover begins to open up on her feelings towards performing live poetry, she states  &ldquo;Nerves always get to me. I don&#39t know if they&#39ve ever gotten the best of me, never in reciting poetry. But I think nerves, even though they&#39re seen as a bad thing, can actually help you for some reason.&rdquo; This is where I began to see a real sense of positivity. A strong belief that something frightening can coincide peacefully with something exciting therefore creating a whole new experience or as Clover reveals &ldquo;A learning curve.&rdquo;

		As she talks, her conversational style is concise but friendly. When shes&#39; discussing her favourite poet, she is effusive: &#34;my favourite spoken word poet is Sarah Kay. She just writes really amazing poetry, so heartfelt and lyrical and it&#39;s so lovely to watch her perform it&#34; or whether she is providing an explanation of how she focuses on the layers of meaning of a poem, adding more emotional depth and inflections &dash; &ldquo;I try to marry up an emotion or a time when I had felt envy and think of how that felt and then how the person in the poem feels.&rdquo; I think I am beginning to discover the admirable personality of Clover Kayne.
		&ldquo;Personally, when I was in lower school, I would look up to the sixth form and think &#39gosh they are so amazing, they are so old and they know so much&#39 I&#39m still looking up to the sixth formers. I&#39m surrounded by them, but I&#39m still looking up to them .&rdquo; She tells me. &ldquo;You don&#39t have to glean inspiration from someone that&#39s older than you. Sometimes I feel inspired by people who are younger than me for various reasons. So the advice I give would be to glean inspiration from anything that is admirable.&rdquo; Spoken like a true inspiring poet.
		Update: Since this interview was recorded, Clover went on to win the Poetry By Heart county and regional finals, finishing in the top eight in the country. She also won Young Musician for the first time.
